26.04: Creating index.html, images and styles folders. Finding logo. Preparing folders. Updating Trello board.
27.04: Working on the prototype design. Testing out typography and colors. Deciding on what pages to be built, and creating them. Looking for inspiring images to use in addition to the ones already given in brief.
03.05: CSS Styling. Satisfying to see better understanding of coding in general. Especially how different attributes and values work in CSS. Also, less use of containers, and more general styling.
04.05: Trying to reduce the use of DIV's. Implementing a hamburger menu for smaller devices. Very satisfying to make it quicker and nicer that last time.
