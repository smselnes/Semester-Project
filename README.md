26.04: Creating index.html, images and styles folders. Finding logo. Preparing folders. Updating Trello board.

            Over the course of human history science has developed from our
            early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
            everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
            life itself.
